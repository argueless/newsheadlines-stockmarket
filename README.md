This repository will be examining the relationship between news' headlines and the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

I extracted headlines from 1989-2016 using the New York Times API.
Then, I converted the headlines into scores using Sentiment Analysis, and classified those scores into 5 nominal categories.
Finally, I ran some classification models to predict if the price of the Dow index will go up or down.
